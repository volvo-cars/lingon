# Nope - Kubernetes Operator for managing NATS Accounts

Nope is a Kubernetes Operator for managing [decentralized JWT authentication](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/jwt) for accounts in NATS.

// TODO: write a better sentence above.

## Description

// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/
    ```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/nope:tag
    ```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/nope:tag
    ```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

Nope requires a running NATS instance to communicate with, and the NATS instance has to be configured
with an operator, system account and system user.

In [hack/natsserver](./hack/natsserver/readme.md) there is a Go program that runs an embedded NATS server with the necessary bootstrapping done, and writing the necessary files. Cool!

```bash
# In a terminal where you want to run the nats server
cd hack/natsserver
go run main.go

# In a terminal where you want to run the operator
export NATS_MAIN_URL="nats://0.0.0.0:4222"
export OPERATOR_SEED=$(pwd)/hack/natsserver/operator.nk
export NATS_CREDS=$(pwd)/hack/natsserver/sys_user.creds

# Install CRDs and run the operator
make install run

# If you want to test out some samples, first generate the YAML in config/samples/out
make test
# Apply some samples, e.g.
kubectl apply -f config/samples/out/account_sample.yaml
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
