## Why Go

* Because most outages are caused by a configuration error and a configuration language is the most important tool in the hands of a platform engineer.

* _Configuration as code_ as in programming language code, not JSON, YAML or HCL.

* _Go is a strongly typed language_. IDEs provide a great developer experience with autocompletion and type safety.

* _Tests are a first class citizen_: it makes trivial to write a test to ensure correctness of the configuration

* _Most of the infrastructure tools are written in Go_: i.e. Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, Tekton, ...
  it is easy to interact with them and leverage their APIs/structs.

* _Dependency management_: Go modules provide a simple way
  to manage dependencies and reuse code with the correct version to ensure compatibility

* _Documentation_: Go recommends _godoc_ formatting as it can leverage native comments for each struct's fields
  in order to provide comments/examples in the IDE of the developer, which increase productive and correctness.

* _Quick feedback loop_: Catch most mistakes and incompatibilities in Go compile time.
  Go has very fast compilation time, which feels like you are running a script.

* _Limit the number of languages used in the organization to a minimum_ : Go is one of the cleanest,
  simplest and developer friendly languages that exists.

* _Backwards compatibility_: Go is well-known for its backwards compatibility making
  it a great choice for long-lasting platforms reducing rework through breaking changes.
